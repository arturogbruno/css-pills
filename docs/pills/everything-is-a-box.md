# Everything is a box

Welcome to the "Everything is a Box" CSS pill. Your comprehensive guide to understanding the CSS Box Model and mastering the art of `box-sizing`. In this pill, we'll explore the core concepts of the Box Model, learn why it's a crucial aspect of web design, and dive into the world of `box-sizing` values. Let's get started and embrace the power of boxes!

## What is the CSS Box Model?

The CSS Box Model is a fundamental concept in web design that defines how elements are displayed on a page. Each element is treated as a rectangular box, composed of four components: content, padding, border, and margin.

1. **Content**: The actual content of the element, such as text or images.
2. **Padding**: The space between the content and the border.
3. **Border**: The line surrounding the element and its padding.
4. **Margin**: The space between the element's border and other elements on the page.

## Why is the Box Model important?

The Box Model is essential for determining the layout and visual appearance of a web page. It allows developers to control the spacing, alignment, and dimensions of elements, ensuring a consistent and responsive design.

### Understanding `box-sizing` values

- `content-box`. In this model, the element's width and height are calculated based only on the content, not including padding and border. This can lead to unexpected results when adding padding or borders, as the total size of the element increases.

- `border-box`: In this model, the element's dimensions include the padding and border, making it easier to manage the layout and maintain consistent sizing. This is especially important for responsive designs, where elements need to adapt to different screen sizes.

### `box-sizing` default values

While most HTML elements have their `box-sizing` set to `content-box` by default, there are a few exceptions that use other values. The most notable ones are form elements, which may have different default `box-sizing` values across browsers.

One such element is the `select` element. The `box-sizing` value for this element is often set to `border-box` or another user-agent-specific value by default, as it renders differently across browsers.

Here's a list of some elements that may have non-content-box default box-sizing values:

1. `select`
2. `input`
3. `button`
4. `textarea`

Keep in mind that this is not an exhaustive list, and the default box-sizing values for these elements may vary across browsers. Always test your styles in multiple browsers to ensure consistent rendering.

## Always set your box model to use `box-sizing: border-box`?

Using `box-sizing: border-box` ensures that the element's dimensions include the padding and border, making it easier to manage the layout and maintain consistent sizing. This is especially important for responsive designs, where elements need to adapt to different screen sizes.

## How to add `box-sizing: border-box` to your CSS

To set `box-sizing: border-box` as the default for all elements, you can use the following CSS rule:

```css
:root {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

*,
*::before,
*::after {
  box-sizing: inherit;
}
```

This rule sets the `box-sizing` property to `border-box` for the `:root` element, and then uses the `inherit` keyword for all other elements and their pseudo-elements.

### Overriding `box-sizing` for third-Party components

With this approach, you can easily convert a third-party component to use `content-box` when necessary by targeting its top-level container:

```css
.third-party-component {
  box-sizing: content-box;
}
```

Using the `inherit` keyword allows for greater control and flexibility when working with third-party components and different box-sizing values.

## Why `border-box` is advised instead of content-box

`border-box` is recommended over content-box for several reasons:

1. **Ease of layout management**: With border-box, the total width and height of an element include padding and border, making it simpler to control the element's size and positioning.
2. **Consistent sizing**: border-box helps maintain consistent element sizing, even when padding and borders are added or modified.
3. **Responsive design**: Using border-box allows for a more predictable and adaptable layout in responsive designs, as it accounts for padding and borders in element dimensions.
4. **Better control over third-party components**: Using the `inherit` keyword with `box-sizing: border-box` provides more flexibility when working with third-party components, allowing for easier adjustments of their box-sizing values.

In conclusion, using `box-sizing: border-box` simplifies the layout management process, ensuring a more consistent and responsive design.
